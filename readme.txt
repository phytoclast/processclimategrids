fixaltitude.R 
Fixes a small patch in South America where elevations are zero.

amplifiedElev.R
Creates an alternative 5 km elevation grid which preserves the highest and lowest elevation values from the 1 km elevation grid.
Then it fits the temperature grids to local elevation regressions.


Plots temperature laps rates with idw, to create a sharpening lens to the temperature grids.
